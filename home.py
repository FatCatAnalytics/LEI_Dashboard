This dashboard is a prototype for the FatCat Analytics Corporate Hierarchy Dashboard. It allows users to search for Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) data or corporate names, fetch the hierarchy data, and view the data in an interactive graph. The dashboard is divided into three main sections:

1. **Home**: Information about the dashboard.
2. **Upload Data**: Upload LEI codes or corporate names to fetch the hierarchy data.
3. **Analysis**: View the hierarchy data and search for specific entities.

Use the sidebar to navigate between sections.
